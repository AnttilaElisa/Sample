#Create a program that can write a text file. Prompt the user to insert first name and last name. Then prompt the file name for the write operation. Finally write a text file with first name on the first row and last name on the second row. Ensure that the text file ends in a empty row. Finally exit the program cleanly.

#Example program runs

#run 1
#Program starting.
#Insert first name: Guido
#Insert last name: Rossum
#Insert filename: A6_T2_F1.txt
#Program ending.
