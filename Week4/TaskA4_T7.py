#Create program which prompts the user to insert an integer and then display the steps to calculate the multiplicative persistency based on the user input.

#In short, the steps in the multiplicative persistency is calculated by multiplying digits together in a given integer. This process is then repeated for the result which makes the result value smaller on each iteration till the result contains only one digit.

#The program must stop the iteration when the result contains only one digit. Finally before the program closes, it shows the steps taken.

#Example program runs

#run 1 run 2 run 3 run 4
#Program starting.
print("Program starting.\n")
