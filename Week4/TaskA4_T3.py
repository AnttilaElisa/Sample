#Make Python program which prompts user to insert two integers. Use these integers together with the “while-loop” structure to create behaviour like in the example program run below.

#Note! the autograding tool will test that the correct structure has been applied.

#Example program runs

#run 1
#Program starting.
print("Program starting.\n")

#Insert starting value: 1
Start = int(input("Insert starting value: "))
#Insert stopping value: 10
Stop = int(input("Insert stopping value: "))

#Starting while-loop:
print("\nStarting while-loop:")
while Start <= Stop:
    print(Start, end=" ")
    Start += 1
#1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

#Program ending.
print("\n\nProgram ending.")
